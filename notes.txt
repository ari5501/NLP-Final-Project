What type of model should we be using?
I know about ELMo and Bert, are there others we could try out? How tough are the APIs?

We were talking about doing part of speech tagging of syntax nodes through LSTMs. Any idea how we should go about that?
In addition, the professor said he wants to know what type of tags we plan to use. Is that referring to part of speech tagging?

We want to change around some of the stuff from the buzzer.py file, but we are not really sure which areas to tackle. 
Could you point us in the right direction for that?

What should we do to get the bare minimum part of the project working so we can start working on some cool stuff?

When we download our dataset, do we have to parse it in a specific way? I was wondering because it seems like the training data was 
already in the form of questions
